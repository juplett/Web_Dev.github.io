                        Hello My name is Judah R Plett. 
                        my life so far has been one of adventure.
                        when I was born December 3 2005 my parents moved us
                        to Madagascar; not like the movie there were no lions, 
                        or girafs, or Zebras, there where lemurs there and they 
                        are quite fun to play around with. When I was living in 
                        Madagascar I went to school at a French school where I learned
                        how to speak french as you could porobably guess. After living
                        there for the better part of 11 years we moved back to Canada
                        where I when to River West Park for the last two years of Middle
                        School. I then came here to Shaftbury Hight school and joined PTEC.

                    <h2>My work</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since joining the PTEC program I have made dozens of websites
                        and quite recently have started in technical witing as well.
                        my work so far is prety elementery in the way it looks but i am 
                        enjoying the proccess of makeing each and every page. In technical 
                        writing we have been starting to do more and more writing tasks such 
                        as creating in depth instructional writing projects. If you would like to 
                        see some of the work that I have made you can go to the "My Work" page
                        there you will find all of my work so far.
